# INTERACTIVE SORTING (TOTAL PROJECT COMPLETION: 100%) - REACT/REDUX/CSS

The main objective of this project was to visualize four main sorting algorithms: -Bubble Sort
-Quick Sort
-Merge Sort
-Heap Sort

The user can choose from a dropdown menu which of these algorithms he/she wishes to visualize. They can set with a slider the size of the array (from size 10 to size 100), which is generated randomly with numbers from 3 to 99. The bigger the number (the element of the array), the greater the bar's height. The user is also able to set the speed from 1 to 10 with a slider, where 1 is the slowest speed and 10 is the fastest speed. When the user is done configuring the settings, he needs to click on the SORT text that is on top of the blue bars to visualize the chosen algorithm. (All arrays are organized in ascending order).

Green bars mean the algorithm already compared those with other bars. Red bars are the elements currently being compared.

WHEN FINISHED SORTING, MOVE THE ARRAY SIZE BAR TO GENERATE A NEW RANDOM ARRAY OR JUST CLICK GENERATE NEW ARRAY BUTTON.
